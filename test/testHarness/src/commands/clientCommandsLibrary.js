 * @NOTE Please be aware that the Commands and BusinessRules data fields in the
 * D-data structure are going to display as empty when printing out the D-data structure even when using JSON.stringify().
 * This is because the functions cannot really be serialized in any way. It actually kind of makes sense,
 * but could be really confusing if you are struggling, trying to debug commands or business rules that do not appear to exist.
